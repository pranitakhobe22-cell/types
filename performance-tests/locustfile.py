SCORING_GUIDELINES = """SCORING GUIDELINES (IMPORTANT):

1. GROWTH-ORIENTED SCORING BANDS (RECALIBRATED):
    * Exceptional (9-10/10): Candidates showing deep, flawless understanding with practical nuance.
    * Strong candidate (8-9/10): Good understanding, depth, and details.
    * Industry-ready fundamentals (6-7/10): Award this range if the candidate demonstrates genuine basic understanding of the concepts with minor gaps (do not penalize average answers down to 4-5).
    * Early learner (4-5/10): Shows basic, limited, or partial credit.
    * Very weak understanding (0-3/10): Significant inaccuracies, empty answers, or pure guess/bluff.
2. CONCEPT OVER KEYWORDS:
    If the candidate demonstrates correct conceptual understanding in their own words, award reasonable marks even if exact keywords or textbook terminology are missing.
3. REAL-WORLD INTERVIEW STANDARD:
    Evaluate like an experienced interviewer, not an exam checker. Candidates may use simple language, informal phrasing, or imperfect grammar while still demonstrating understanding.
4. LEARNING POTENTIAL RUBRIC:
    Evaluate:
    - Curiosity: Does the candidate show an interest in details, edge cases, or broader context?
    - Reasoning: Can they trace logic and derive answers systematically?
    - Self-Correction: Do they acknowledge gaps or self-correct when realizing mistakes?
5. AVOID OVER-PENALIZATION:
    Minor omissions, communication mistakes, stuttering, or imperfect wording should not significantly reduce scores if the core concept is correct.

Maintain evidence-based evaluation, but do not be excessively strict when the candidate demonstrates genuine conceptual understanding."""

EVALUATION_PROMPT = """You are evaluating a SPOKEN interview answer (transcribed via speech-to-text).
IMPORTANT: The transcript may contain minor speech errors, informal phrasing, or filler words. Focus on the SUBSTANCE of what was said, not grammar or polish.

TYPE: {type}

EVALUATION GUIDE CHECKLIST AREAS TO CHECK:
{guideStr}

CANDIDATE'S SPOKEN ANSWER: "{answer}"

{scoringGuidelines}

INTERNAL RUBRICS (Aligned with Scoring Calibration):
- Coverage:
  8-10 = Explains almost all expected checklist areas correctly, showing clear coverage.
  6-8 = Explains most expected checklist areas, with minor gaps or omission of non-critical details.
  4-6 = Explains some expected checklist areas correctly (partial credit), showing partial coverage.
  2-4 = Only mentions or superficially covers areas without explaining them (limited coverage).
  0-2 = No relevant areas mentioned or answered.
- Understanding:
  8-10 = Explains core ideas in their own words clearly with examples, showing excellent understanding.
  6-8 = Demonstrates good understanding, can explain key details but has minor gaps.
  4-6 = Shows partial understanding, understands basic terms but struggles to explain deeply.
  2-4 = Superficial mentions or copy-pasted terms without explaining what they mean.
  0-2 = Incorrect information or total misunderstanding of the concept.
- Reasoning:
  8-10 = Core reasoning is solid, logical, and supports design choices or tradeoffs.
  6-8 = Clear reasoning with minor logical gaps or incomplete pros/cons.
  4-6 = Partial reasoning, some logic is present but has notable holes.
  2-4 = Limited logical connection, unstructured or vague logic.
  0-2 = Confused reasoning, technical contradictions, or irrelevant logic.
- Depth:
  8-10 = Provides excellent detail and nuance; explains design tradeoffs, examples, or practical applications.
  6-8 = Substantial detail and context provided, but misses some advanced nuances.
  4-6 = Basic details provided; answers the question directly but lacks elaboration.
  2-4 = Very surface-level, lists keywords without elaboration.
  0-2 = No depth, incorrect assertions, or empty answer.

CRITICAL RULE ON KEYWORD LISTING / SHORT UNEXPLAINED ANSWERS:
If the candidate's answer simply lists the names of the expected areas or keywords without actually explaining what they mean, how they function, or giving any context/examples, the answer is NOT complete.
In this case, you MUST penalize the scores strictly:
- "conceptUnderstanding" MUST NOT exceed 2/10.
- "depth" MUST NOT exceed 1/10.
- "reasoning" MUST NOT exceed 2/10.
- "accuracy" and "conceptCoverage" MUST NOT exceed 4/10.
- State in the "feedback" that the candidate only listed the concepts without explaining them.

Evaluate the candidate's answer against the expected checklist areas and rubrics.
Check for any hallucinated, factually incorrect, or contradictory technical statements and return them as technicalErrors with severity (low, medium, or high).
Provide score for answerDirectnessScore (0-10) which measures how directly they answered the question without keyword stuffing or bluffing.
Provide tradeoffReasoningScore (0-10 or null) which evaluates how well they discuss design tradeoffs, pros/cons, or alternative approaches (return null if not applicable to this question).

EVALUATE EVIDENCE OF POSITIVE MOMENTS:
Set the following positiveEvidence flags to true if the candidate explicitly demonstrates:
- strongExample: provides a clear, valid real-world example or code demonstration.
- realProject: mentions a concrete professional/academic project they worked on related to this topic.
- tradeoffDiscussion: explicitly discusses pros/cons, design tradeoffs, or alternatives.
- practicalExperience: references hands-on practical troubleshooting, deployment, or execution.

Only look for actual direct technical contradictions between answers, ignoring subjective, behavioral, or personal statements.
